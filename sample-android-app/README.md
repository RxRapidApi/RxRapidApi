# Building the Android Sample

You will need to put a few property values into a ```local.properties``` file.  Firstly go onto
the RapidAPI website and create a project - you'll need a project name and an API key.  If you want
to run the Nasa demo, you'll want to register for a Nasa API key also.

## local.properties
```
zillow.api.key=...
nasa.api.key=...
rapidapi.api.key=...
rapidapi.project.name=...
```
